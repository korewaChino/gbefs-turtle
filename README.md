# Greedy Best-first Search turtle pathfinder

This is an example of a simple turtle pathfinder using a Greedy Best-first Search algorithm.

It tries to pathfind from a point to another point in a 2D grid, assuming there are no obstacles in the way.

A ComputerCraft version of this program can also be found in this repository.
